At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it\\'s a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.\\nSo, let\\'s look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don\\'t think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren\\'t working. One of the three that was, didn\\'t print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you\\'ve gone to McDonald\\'s at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I\\'ve garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren\\'t going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn\\'t happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren\\'t calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.\\nOk... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.\\nMy in-laws are visiting and at this point I\\'m trying to figure why they haven\\'t received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn\\'t have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn\\'t printing receipts?).\\nThe person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the \"abandoned order\" area. If we hadn\\'t said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.\\nAside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I\\'m not sure if they just didn\\'t staff well on this shift, but like I said, I\\'ve talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"nltk.download('stopwords')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.896680Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.897047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.905398Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.897016Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.904069Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":80,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":80,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"True"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(stopwords.words('english'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.907193Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.908023Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.915385Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.907978Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-07T14:29:45.913996Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":81,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"['i', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'we', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'you', \"you're\", \"you've\", \"you'll\", \"you'd\", 'your', 'yours', 'yourself', 'yourselves', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'himself', 'she', \"she's\", 'her', 'hers', 'herself', 'it', \"it's\", 'its', 'itself', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs', 'themselves', 'what', 'which', 'who', 'whom', 'this', 'that', \"that'll\", 'these', 'those', 'am', 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'be', 'been', 'being', 'have', 'has', 'had', 'having', 'do', 'does', 'did', 'doing', 'a', 'an', 'the', 'and', 'but', 'if', 'or', 'because', 'as', 'until', 'while', 'of', 'at', 'by', 'for', 'with', 'about', 'against', 'between', 'into', 'through', 'during', 'before', 'after', 'above', 'below', 'to', 'from', 'up', 'down', 'in', 'out', 'on', 'off', 'over', 'under', 'again', 'further', 'then', 'once', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'how', 'all', 'any', 'both', 'each', 'few', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'some', 'such', 'no', 'nor', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'same', 'so', 'than', 'too', 'very', 's', 't', 'can', 'will', 'just', 'don', \"don't\", 'should', \"should've\", 'now', 'd', 'll', 'm', 'o', 're', 've', 'y', 'ain', 'aren', \"aren't\", 'couldn', \"couldn't\", 'didn', \"didn't\", 'doesn', \"doesn't\", 'hadn', \"hadn't\", 'hasn', \"hasn't\", 'haven', \"haven't\", 'isn', \"isn't\", 'ma', 'mightn', \"mightn't\", 'mustn', \"mustn't\", 'needn', \"needn't\", 'shan', \"shan't\", 'shouldn', \"shouldn't\", 'wasn', \"wasn't\", 'weren', \"weren't\", 'won', \"won't\", 'wouldn', \"wouldn't\"]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"text-align:center;
